|Problem 24|
\==========/

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.
The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

/===========\
|Explanation|
\===========/

For this problem, we can take advantage of the fact that any permutation of characters or numbers is divisible by every number below the number of objects in the permutation.
This means that 10!, the number of permutations for the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 is divisible into 10 evenly sized subsets.
We can use the starts and ends of these permutations of numbers to delineate the starts and ends of different subsets of answers.
Each of these subsets is characterized by a different starting digit.

Once we determine which subset our answer is in lexicographically (since each delineation occurs based on the permutation's rank lexicogrphically),
We can zoom into that subset and repeat the process.
The number of the section we are selecting helps us decide which character to use from the remaining unused numbers.

Our 1,000,000th ranked lexicogrpahic string is also the x'th ranked string after we begin searching in this new subset.
In the new subset, there are 9 equal division that we can search through, each marked by the start of a different yet unused number.
We can repeat this process until there are no numbers remaining.

The answer is 2783915460.

|Problem 26|
\==========/

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2	= 	0.5
1/3	= 	0.(3)
1/4	= 	0.25
1/5	= 	0.2
1/6	= 	0.1(6)
1/7	= 	0.(142857)
1/8	= 	0.125
1/9	= 	0.(1)
1/10	= 	0.1
Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

|Explanation|
\===========/

This problem can be trivially solved with an understanding of full reptend primes.
Full reptend primes are numbers with a maximally repeating reciprocal decimal cycle.
There is a formula for determing if a number will have a maximal set-size of p-1.

We merely need to use this formula on known primes below the limit.

Instead of checking on all numbers starting from the start of our primes list,
we can start by checking numbers from the back of the list.

We can keep track of the largest period size of each prime, continuing until we reach the first full reptend prime.
The largest continuing cycle comes courtesy of this full reptend prime or a previous prime with a larger period.

That number, with an upper limit of 1000, is 983.

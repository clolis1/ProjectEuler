\==========/

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

    n^2 + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 <= n <= 39.
However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41,
and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41. 
 
The incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered,
which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0 <= n <= 79.

The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479. 
 
Considering quadratics of the form:

    n^2 + an + b, where |a| <= 1000 and |b| <= 1000

where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4
Find the product of the coefficients, a and b
for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.

|Explanation|
\===========/

The starting size of the solution set to this problem is 4,000,000, encompassing every combination of |a| <= 1000, |b| <= 1000.
However, we can reduce the size of this solution set by disqualifying certain values of a and b.

For example, the quadratic formula n^2 + an + b cannot express a prime number when n = 0 if b itself is not prime.
Additionally, since all prime numbers except for 2 are even, this then indicates that a cannot be even.
If a is even, this would result in the formula expressing an even integer when n is also odd. (Thus limiting consecutive primes to just 1).

The resulting limited brute frce algorithm determines that the greatest amount of consecutive primes can be generated when
a = -61 and b = 971.

The product of these two numbers is -59231.

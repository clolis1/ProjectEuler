The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction,
as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8,
which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value,
and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

|Explanation|
\===========/

This problem can be solved by brute-forcing cancellation of like digits between all 2-digit numbers.
If the quotient of the reduced numbers is the same as the quotient of the 2-digit numbers,
then we have found one of our 4 special cases.

We can ignore all numbers with zeroes in them, since they are trivial cases.

We calculate the prime factorization of the numerator and the denominator. Then we remove the shared factors.

The simplified denominator is 100.

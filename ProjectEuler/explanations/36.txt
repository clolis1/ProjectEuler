\==========/

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001v2 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

|Explanation|
\===========/

A trivial problem, since we already have a method that checks if a string is s palindrome.

Simply use the built-in toString() and toBinaryString() methods and check if a number is a palindrome in both forms.

The sum of these numbers is 872187.

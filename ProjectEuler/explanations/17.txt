|Problem 16|
\==========/

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?


NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.
The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

|Explanation|
\===========/

A trivial problem. Create a series of if-statements and switches that will add to a total sum based on the inputted number.

Numbers 1-19 are handled separately as they have unique nomenclature.
Otherwise, the amount of letters is added to a total when a number is counted.
A series of switch statements is all that is required.

The total amount of letters is 21124.

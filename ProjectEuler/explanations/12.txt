|Problem 12|
\==========/

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

|Explanation|
\===========/

This problem can be solved by generating a list of triangle numbers and then determining their divisors.
To save time, we can find a quick way to generate a list of divisors.
We can further optimize the process by determining the parameters a number must have to have at least 500 divisors.

A triangle number can be defined by the equation T = n(n+1)/2. n and (n+1) are necessarily relatively prime.
Since n and n+1 are coprime, we can determine the amount of divisors between two smaller numbers more easily than one larger number.
If two numbers are coprime, the amount of divisors of their product is equal to the product of their number of divisors.
Thus, we can quickly determine the number of divisors for any triangle number.

The answer is 76576500.

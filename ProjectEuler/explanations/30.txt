|Problem 30|
\==========/

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

|Explanation|
\===========/

Initially, I tried to determine if there was a mathematical trick to finding these special numbers,
but cursory research indicates that there is not.

As a result, a brute force search is required.
There is a choice between a search of consecutive numbers, or a search of combinations of addends.

I chose to brute force search combinations of addends.
(Although all addends are single-digit numbers to the fifth power, they are essentially just 10 static values).

The lower limit for this problem can be any combination of any length.
The upper limit is determined by how large the largest addend may be.

In this case, 6 addends of 9^5 do not come close to their "spelled" version of 999999.
Therefore, there is no point in checking combinations of numbers greater than 6.

We will check every combination of numbers up to a length of 6.
If their sum contains all of the necessary numbers (and any amount of zeroes), a match is found.

The sum of these sums is 443839.

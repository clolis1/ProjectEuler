\==========/

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier,
and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

\===========/

We can solve this by first realizing that any product must be four digits long.
Thus, we can create two restrictions to incredibly narrow our solution set.

We must go through combinations of numbers that multiply to a four digit product,
e.g. 1000 <= i * j < 10000
as well as the resulting set (or String, in this case) containing precisely one of each digit 1-9.

In this case, because we can confirm that there are exactly 9 digits, we merely have to check for the presence of each
digit with a search function, since if all are found it also necessitates that there are no zeores or duplicates.

The TreeSet ensures that there are no duplicate products.

The final result is 45228.

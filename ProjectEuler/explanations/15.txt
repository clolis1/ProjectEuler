|Problem 15|
\==========/

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down,
there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

/===========\
|Explanation|
\===========/

This problem is a permutation with 40 objects, 20 right-turns and 20-down-turns.

However, The right turns and down turns are indistinct.
Therefore, order matters only insofar as D's relate to R's, and not turns of the same kind.

So our permutation equation will look like: 40!/(20!)(20!)

Because there are 40 spaces and two sets of distinct objects numbered at 20 each

Ultimately, there are 137846528820 distinct paths to take.

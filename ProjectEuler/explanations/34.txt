145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

|Explanation|
\===========/

This problem can be brute forced by testing out every combination of factorials up to 7 multiplicands.
Actually, it is probably the case with cursory testing that no curious number has 7 digits.
This is because the largest one-digit factorial, 9!, is only 362880.
9! * 6 is 2177280. 8! is only 40320, and cannot meaningfully contribute to adding towards large 6-digit numbers.

This merely means we do not have to check 7 digit dombinations beyond combinations that necessarily include and at least 3 9!'s.

The sum of these curious numbers is 40730.

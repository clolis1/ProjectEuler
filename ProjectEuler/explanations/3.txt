|Problem 3 Explanation|
\=====================/

This problem calls for the greatest prime factor of a number as its solution.

We obtain this number by performing the modulo operation on the given value with all values, using an iterator starting with 2.
If our target number is found to be divisible by our iterator, that number is a prime factor.
The quotient of our target number divided by the iterator is stored every time a suitable divisor is found.

If our iterator is ever larger than the square root of our remaining value, we have completed the algorithm.
The list of prime factors will be all the divisors as well as the final quotient value.

In this case, the largest prime factor is 6857.

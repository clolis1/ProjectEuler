**NOTE: Explanation partly copied from Problem 7**

We can determine if a number is prime by seeing if it is divisible by all numbers up until its square root.

If a number is not divisible by any number iteratively up until that point, it is prime.
This is because the square root is a factor that is paired with itself;
Every other number between 1 and the square root is paired with a number between the square root and half the number we are testing.

We can simply add together all prime numbers up until this point.

The sum of all prime numbers whose values are individually less than 2,000,000 is 142,913,828,922.

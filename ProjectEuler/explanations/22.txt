|Problem 22|
\==========/

Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

|Explanation|
\===========/

For this problem, I began by reading the names.txt file and inserting the contents into an ArrayList.
They are inserted in the unsorted order they are given.

The array is sorted according to TimSort (the default Collections.sort()).

The sums for each word are tallied up, multiplied by their index in the list, and added to the total sum.

The total sum is 871198282.

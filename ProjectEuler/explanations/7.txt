|Explanation|
\===========/

We can determine if a number is prime by seeing if it is divisible by all numbers up until its square root.

If a number is not divisible by any number iteratively up until that point, it is prime.
This is because the square root is a factor that is paired with itself;
Every other number between 1 and the square root is paired with a number between the square root and half the number we are testing.

Thus, the 10,001st prime number is 104743.

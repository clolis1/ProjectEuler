|Problem 21|
\==========/

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

|Explanation|
\===========/

For this problem, I began by determing the sum of proper divisors for each number between 0 and 10000 (non-inclusive).
I did this by counting up to the square root of each number and determining if a given number was a possible divisor (by using the modulus function).

There is room for improvment in this section- for very large numbers, it would be faster to determine all the prime factors of a number
and use those numbers to generate a list of proper divisors.

A list of numbers along with their proper-divisor-sums is tabulated until the limit of 10000 is reached.
At this point, the list is iterated through-- every number has its proper-divisor-sum compared with its corresponding pair.
Discovered amicable pairs are added to the sum total.

There is room for imrpovement in this section.
It is possible to save one iteration through the list by calculating the sum while forming the initial list.
This would involve investigating the proper-divisor-sum's corresponding key-value out of turn during the development of the list.
As long as the original location is remembered, this out-of-turn exploration will remove the need for a second run-through of the list.

The sum of all amicable numbers between 0 and 10000 (non-inclusive) is 31626.

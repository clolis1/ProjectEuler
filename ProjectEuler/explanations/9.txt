A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

				a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

|Explanation|
\===========/

In this problem, we need to find a set of natural numbers that satisfies both equations, a + b + c = 1000 and a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

There are countless combinations of numbers that would satisfy the first equation, so it's more prudent to find combinations that satisfy the second.
In other words, it's easier to find Pyhtagorean triples.

There exists a method of determining all primitive Pythagorean triples using two underlying parameters (with set restrictions) and a specific set of equations:

a = uv
b = (u^2 - v^2)/2
c = (u^2 + v^2)/2

where u > v > 0, and u, v are both odd and relatively prime.

We can iterate through pairs of u and v to generate primitive triples where a + b + c <= 1000.
We can also multiply the triplets of a,b,c by natural numbers to generate more Pythagorean triples.

By combing throgh all of these generated triples, we can find a set that satisfies the conditions of the problem.
Then we can solve for abc.

abc is 31875000.

|Problem 38|
\==========/

Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576.
We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?

|Explanation|
\===========/

A big help for this problem is that the set of numbers we are multiplying our number by always starts with 1.
Thus, the ranges of numbers we must test always start and end with a power of ten.
The ranges end when we result with a new product whose value takes us over 9 total digits.

There are 4 cases where a 9-digit pandigital number can be formed with the concatenations:

One 1-digit number and four 2-digit numbers
Three 2-digit numbers and one 3-digit number
Three 3-digit numbers
One 4-digit number and one 5-digit number

Each of these cases has parameters on what a number can be to fit these ranges while multiplying into (1, 2, ... , n)
These ranges for the bounds for our loops.

The largest pandgitial number is 932718654.

|Problem 37|
\==========/

The number 3797 has an interesting property.
Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right,
and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7.
Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

/===========\
|Explanation|
\===========/

We can solve this problem by using out old functions for determining primes and adding an extra step to them.
Instead of simply adding the primes to a set, we can also check each prime for truncatability.
Since we already have a set of primes lesser than the one being tested for truncatability,
testing for truncatability is trivial.

The sum of the numbers is 748317.

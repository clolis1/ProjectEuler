|Problem 23|
\==========/

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number.
For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16,
the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis,
it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though
it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

|Explanation|
\===========/

For this problem, I began by ascertaining the sums of the proper divisors of all numbers less than the given limit of 28123.
Then, I determined that all even numbers greater than 46, as well as the even numbers 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 40, 42, and 44
were the sums of two abundant numbers.

This allows me to focus on finding odd numbers which are also the sums of two abundant numbers.
We can do this by determing which number are abundant (by using the test which earlier determined the sums of numbers' proper divisors.
We then add the full list of abundant numbers to each odd abundant number in our list, marking which numbers become sums.

Finally, we tally up the array of numbers once all of our marks are set.

We get 4179871.

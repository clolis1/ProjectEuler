A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

|Explanation|
\===========/

The answer to the problem we are looking for is the largest number shared between the following two sets:
	1. The set of palindromes
	2. The set of products of two 3-digit numbers

Generating the sets of largest palindromes and largest products is trivial.
However, it is unnecessary to generate the entirety of these sets to find our answer.
We can discover numbers that meet the criteria of both sets, and then forgo generating new products that will certainly not be larger.

This is solved by using a nested for-loop where each loop iterates consecutively on each number in the pair.
If, while descending, a number-pair is found to have a product less than the current largest known palindrome,
it is proven that any further products would also fail to be larger, so the loop ends.

Eventually, this process will conclude when the first number in the pair multipled by 999 (the greatest 3-digit integer),
is found to be less than the largest known palindrome (which becomes the largest definitive palindrome).

This number is 906609.

|Problem 19|
\==========/

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

|Explanation|
\===========/

This problem can be solved trivially by performing some arithmetic calculation beforehand.

Additionally, this solution might be extrapolated to calendars with any variable number of months, days in a month, week's length, etc.

Without considering leap-years, every year will have a set amount of Sundays landing on the first day of a month.
We can determine the amount of Sundays in a year by checking what day the first day of the year is, leaving just 7 possibilities per year.
For leap years, there are seven more possibilities to consider.

We know which years will be leap years, and we know how many days are in both regular years, and leap years, so it is trivial to determine
what day starts a year if we work iteratively.

By iterating from 1901 to 2000, we can add up the sums of all months that start with a Sunday for our answer.

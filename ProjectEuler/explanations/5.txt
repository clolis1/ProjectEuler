2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

|Explanation|
\===========/

In order to be evenly divisible by a number, the number being divided must contain all the prime factors of the divisor in its set of prime factors.
To be evenly divisible by a set of numbers, the dividend must share at least all the prime factors from the sets of each number it is evenly disivisble by.

In this case, the number we are looking for must contain a set of prime factors that minimally satisfies each set of the numbers 1-20.
We can do this by discovering the prime factors of each number 1-20.
We can then create a shared set that includes the minimum number of prime factors to satisfy each of the numbers individually.

Our answer is the product of all of these prime numbers: 232792560
